As per point number 4 of my plans of the week, 11 March 2024 - 17 March 2024, I plan to do as much front-end revision as possible. I say revision because many moons ago I did quiet a bit of the [MDN Frontend Developer Curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/), that and a few too many YouTube tutorials.
